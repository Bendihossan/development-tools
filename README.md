Dev Tools
=========

A composer project (because I like composer) of common tools I use when coding.

Install
=======

1) Install composer:
```
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
```

2) Move to a bin directory in your path
```
mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/
```

3) Install vendors
```
composer install --dev
```

4) Done! Now the binaries from the project are installed in /usr/local/bin/
